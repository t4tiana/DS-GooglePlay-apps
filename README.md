# Purpose
In order to demonstrate my abilities in data cleaning and EDA, I downloaded the [Google Play Store Apps Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and used Jupyter Lab to run a series of analyses.

# How I selected the dataset
While there are many public datasets available for the Apple App Store, there aren't as many for the Google Play Store and I thought it would be interesting to explore this data since I am an Android user. The publisher of the dataset said it wasn't easy to scrape data from the Google Play Store, so I guessed there would be ample opportunity to get meaningful practice in cleaning the data before using it.</br>
